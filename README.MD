#TO-DO LIST

I did this to-do list back in May 2017 following probably the best course for beginners in coding and web, Practical JavaScript in the Watch and Code site ( watchandcode.com ). It was thanks to this course that I started building simple web applications and thinking about code organisation, it was here that I learned about the MVC structure and so on, and the things I learned here I applied them to all my projects. Well designed courses and teachers with good teaching skills are rare things, so that course is absolutely recommendable to all beginners out there, and it deserves this long mention.


One of these days I will continue working on this app. Some of the things to improve:
* ~~user can enter new task by just pressing enter after typing the new task~~ done;
* user can see the tasks look like tiles, tokens or cards, each with the text, an x and a checkbox inside;
* user can rename task by just clicking on the text of the task itself and typing new name and hitting enter;
* user can see only one button: the Add button;
* if there are one or more elements in the list, user can see a second button: the Toggle All button;
* user can delete task by just clicking the small x inside the task;
* ~~user can toggle task (to do/ done) by just clicking on the small check-box inside the task~~ done but differently;


Later on I will think about logging in capabilities and saving data and user info...
